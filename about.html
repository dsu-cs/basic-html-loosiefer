    <h1> Lucy's Buffy the Vampire Slayer Summary</h1>
        <p>
            Buffy the Vampire Slayer aired from 1997 to 2003 on UPN. The show is centered around a 16-year-old girl named Buffy Summers and she is known as "The Chosen One" or "The Slayer." 
            The term "vampire slayer" only covers a small portion of the supernatural evil creatures she must "slay" over the course of 7 seasons. Buffy (middle) has three main friends that aid in her adventures: Giles (her watcher, second from the left), Willow (tech-savvy, studies witchcraft, right side in orange), and Xander (he doesn't really do much and he isn't my favorite character, left side in blue).
            Lastly, we have Cordelia in the blue. She's my favorite character and she's there for comedic relief but very self-centered but has great character development over the series.
